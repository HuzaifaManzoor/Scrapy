we fetch data from css selector 

response.css(tagname.class_name)  ####### it can get more attributes as well 

store response in variable 

books = response.css(tagname.class_name)
len(books) ### all books of pages 

book = books[0]  ## first book 

get the text of first book

get price of book 
 --> book.css('.product_price .price_color::text').get()   ## it use . before name of class
